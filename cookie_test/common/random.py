    """
    Set random generator seed for Python interpreter, NumPy and PyTorch. When setting the seed for PyTorch,
    if CUDA device is available, manual seed for CUDA will also be set. Finally, if `deterministic=True`,
    and CUDA device is available, PyTorch CUDNN backend will be configured to `benchmark=False`
    and `deterministic=True` to yield as deterministic result as possible. For more details, refer to
    PyTorch documentation on reproducibility: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html

    Beware that the seed setting is a "best effort" towards deterministic run. However, as detailed in the above
    documentation, there are certain PyTorch CUDA operations that are inherently non-deterministic, and there is
    no simple way to control for them. Thus, it is best to assume that when CUDA is utilized, operation of the
    PyTorch module will not be deterministic and thus
    not completely reproducible.

    Args:
        seed (int): seed value to be set
        deterministic (bool, optional): If True, CUDNN backend (if available) is set to be deterministic.
            Defaults to True. Note that if set
            to False, the CUDNN properties remain untouched and it NOT explicitly set to False.
